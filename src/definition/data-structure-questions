Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.Data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified
efficiently. Data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations
 that can be applied to the data.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. General operations performed on a data structure are -
- Insertion, to add items to it
- Deletion, to remove items from it
- Modification, to modify items
- Searching, to search for a particular item
- Sorting, to sort the items in a required order.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. The name of areas are:
· Compiler Design,
· Operating System,
· Database Management System,
· Statistical analysis package,
· Numerical Analysis,
· Graphics,
· Artificial Intelligence,
· Simulation

what is an Array?
A. An array, in the context of Java, is a dynamically-created object that serves as a container to hold constant number
of values of the same type. By declaring an array, memory space is allocated for values of a particular type

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A.Array is a fixed size data structure where as in Arraylist we can modify length by appending elements afterwards.
For array we have to mention size earlier because fixed memory has to be allocated before but in Arraylist mentioning size is not fixed.
One more difference is that Arraylist cannot hold primitive datatypes as it can hold only objects referring to datatype.

what is LinkedList?
A.Linked List are linear data structures where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate
object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node.


How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. an array requires less memory than a linked list for storing the same number of elements.
An array is the data structure that contains a collection of similar type data elements whereas the Linked list is considered as non-primitive
data structure contains a collection of unordered linked elements known as nodes.
In the array the elements belong to indexes,  In a linked list though, you have to start from the head and work your way through until you get the element you are looking for.
In an array, memory is assigned during compile time while in a Linked list it is allocated during execution or runtime.
Arrays are of fixed size. In contrast, Linked lists are dynamic and flexible and can expand and contract its size.
Operations like insertion and deletion in arrays consume a lot of time. On the other hand, the performance of these operations in Linked lists is fast.
Elements are stored consecutively in arrays whereas it is stored randomly in Linked lists

what is queue?
A.Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner. Among the exceptions are priority queues, which order elements
according to a supplied comparator, or the elements' natural ordering, and LIFO queues (or stacks) which order the elements LIFO (last-in-first-out).

what is stack?
A.It is a collection that is based on the last in first out (LIFO) principle. On Creation, a stack is empty. It extends
Vector class with five methods that allow a vector to be treated as a stack.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
